  Satisfied: `I remember that night, I just might regret that night for the rest of my days.
I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves to win our praise.
I remember that dreamlike candlelight like a dream that you can’t quite place,
but Alexander, I’ll never forget the first time I saw your face.
I have never been the same, Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame,
And when you said “Hi,” I forgot my dang name, set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame,
This is not a game…
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied.
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. You forget yourself.
You’re like me. I’m never satisfied.
Is that right?
I have never been satisfied.
My name is Angelica Schuyler.
Alexander Hamilton.
Where’s your fam’ly from?
Unimportant. There’s a million things I haven’t done but just you wait, just you wait…
So so so— so this is what it feels like to match wits with someone at your level!
What the hell is the catch? It’s the feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light,
it’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right? The conversation lasted two minutes,
maybe three minutes, ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s a dream and it’s a bit of a dance,
a bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance. He’s a bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give it a chance.
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer? His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants.
Handsome, boy, does he know it! Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place, then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is...
Helpless…
And I know she is...
Helpless…
And her eyes are just…
Helpless…
And I realize
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time…
Where are you taking me?
I’m about to change your life.
Then by all means, lead the way.
Number one!
I’m a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich.
My father has no sons so I’m the one who has to social climb for one,
so I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in New York City is insidious,
Alexander is penniless, Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less.
Elizabeth Schuyler. It’s a pleasure to meet you.
Schuyler?
My sister.
Number two!
He’s after me cuz I’m a Schuyler sister. That elevates his status, I’d have to be naïve to set that aside,
maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza, now that’s his bride.
Nice going, Angelica, he was right, You will never be satisfied.
Thank you for all your service.
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it.
I’ll leave you to it.
Number three!
I know my sister like I know my own mind, you will never find anyone as trusting or as kind.
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned, he’d be mine. She would say, “I’m fine”
She’d be lying.
But when I fantasize at night it’s Alexander’s eyes,
as I romanticize what might have been if I hadn’t sized him up so quickly.
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife; at least I keep his eyes in my life…
To the groom! To the groom! To the groom!
To the bride!
ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)
To the bride! To the bride! To the bride!
From your sister,
Angelica! Angelica!
who is always by your side.
By your side.
By your side.
To your union,
To the union! To the union! To the revolution!
To the revolution!
and the hope that you provide.
You provide! You provide! You provide!
May you always
Be satisfied. Be satisfied. Be satisfied. She’ll be happy as
his bride. And I know he will never be satisfied. I will never be satisfied.`,


'Aaron Burr, Sir': `1776, New York City
Pardon me, are you Aaron Burr, sir?
That depends, who's asking?
Oh well sure, sir, I'm Alexander Hamilton,
I'm at your service, sir, I have been looking for you
I'm getting nervous
Sir, I heard your name at Princeton, I was seeking an accelerated course of study
When I got sort out of sorts with a buddy of yours,
I may have punched him, It’s a blur, sir, He handles the financials—
You punched the bursar?
Yes, I wanted to do what you did - graduate in two, then join the revolution
He looked at me like I was stupid, I’m not stupid.
So how’d you do it? How’d you graduate so fast?
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed
You're an orphan! Of course, I'm an orphan, God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more than anyone bargained for..
Can I buy you a drink?
That would be nice
While we’re talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less
What?
Smile more... Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for
You can't be serious
You want to get ahead?
Yes
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead
Yo yo yo yo yo! What time is it?
Showtime!
...like I said...
Showtime! Showtime! Yo!
I’m John Laurens in the place to be! Uh, two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm working on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me Cause I will pop chick-a-pop these cops 'til I'm free!
Ah oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette! The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!". Tell the king, “Casse-toi!” Who's the best? C’est moi!
Brrrah, brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin’ it. Yes I heard your mother say “come again?”
Lock up your daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets
Wow, No more sex
Pour me another brew, son!
Let’s raise a couple more to the revolution!
Well if it ain’t the prodigy of Princeton College
Aaron Burr
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge
Good luck with that. You’re takin’ a stand
You spit, I’mma sit. We’ll see where we land
Burr, the revolution’s imminent
What do you stall for?
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what’ll you fall for?
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?
Who, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?
